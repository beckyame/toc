# NextArch Project Proposal Process

## Introduction
This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into the NextArch Foundation. 

## Project Landscape

The Project Landscape contains all donated, collaborated, upstream, downstream projects in NextArch Foundation.

The information should contain the project name, Area, Abstract, Link, SIG belonging, and Introduction Materials.

You can update the project-landscape by setting a [Pull Request](project-landscape.md) to submit projects.

## Project stages
NextArch projects have a maturity level of incubating and graduated, which corresponds to the Innovators, Early Adopters, and Early Majority tiers of the Crossing the Chasm diagram. 

The maturity level is a signal by NextArch as to what sorts of enterprises should be adopting different projects. 

Projects increase their maturity by demonstrating their sustainability to NextArch’s Technical Oversight Committee(TOC).

### Project donation process
- You can set up a proposal by submitting an issue in the [TOC repo](https://github.com/nextarch/toc).
  - The information should contain the project name, Area, Abstract, Goal, SIG belonging, and Presentation Materials.
  - If the project doesn’t belong to any existing SIG, you can submit an issue in the toc repo to discuss whether to set up a new SIG.

- The SIG that the new project belongs will review the project and give advice. After improvement, the SIG Tech Leader will recommend the project to TOC.
- TOC will vote for the project at the TOC meeting and announce it at the meeting (approved by a two-thirds vote).
- The incubation of the projects will be determined by TOC in the future.

### Incubation process
All exceptions (and "no" outcomes) are handled by the TOC.

1. Project Proposal
   - Project proposed through a issue in the [TOC repo](https://github.com/nextarch/toc).

2. TOC Review
   - The TOC may agree that the project does not (yet) meet the Incubation requirements and give feedback on why this is the case. 
   - TOC reviews proposal and presentation materials in issue, project passes for inclusion with two-thirds vote of TOC
   - TOC may engage with project to ask further questions
   - If the vote is not conclusive after 6 weeks, TOC may extend vote, or conclude that silence = abstain

### Graduation process
TBD
