# NextArch Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)
NextArch Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)
The NextArch TOC is the technical governing body of the NextArch Foundation. It admits and oversees all projects in the NextArch Foundation and has a mandate to facilitate driving neutral consensus for:

- defining and maintaining the technical vision for the NextArch Foundation,
- approving new projects within the scope for NextArch, and create a conceptual architecture for the projects, aligning projects, removing or archiving projects,
- accepting feedback from end user committee and map to projects,
- aligning interfaces to components under management (code reference implementations before standardizing), and defining common practices to be implemented across NextArch projects, if any.

## Election schedule
Candidate can nominate and participate in the election by submitting a [PR for approval](docs/election.md). For new TOC nominations, TOC will vote for them at the TOC meeting and announce them in real-time at the meeting (at least fifty percent). 



## Meeting Time
TBD

## TOC Responsibilities
a. The TOC will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project. 

b. The TOC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the “CONTRIBUTING” file within the Project’s code repository. The TOC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TOC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file.  Any meetings of the Technical Oversight Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person. 

c. TOC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TOC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented: 

   - Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project; 
 
   - Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository;
 
   - A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.
 
d. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter. 

e. The TOC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TOC roles, as it sees fit.

f. The TOC may elect a TOC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TOC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TOC.  The TOC Chair, or any other TOC member so designated by the TOC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and the NextArch Foundation of The Linux Foundation.

g. Responsibilities: The TOC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

   - coordinating the technical direction of the Project;
 
   - approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope);
 
   - organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;
   - creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;
   - appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;
   - establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;
   - approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the “Series Manager”) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;
   - discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects;
   - coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project.


## TOC Voting
a. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TOC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TOC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

b. Quorum for TOC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TOC to be present. The TOC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

c. Except as provided in Section 7.c. and 8.a in the [Technical Charter](https://github.com/nextarch/foundation/blob/main/technical-charter.md), decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the TOC.

d. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the TOC, any voting member of the TOC may refer the matter to the Series Manager for assistance in reaching a resolution.
